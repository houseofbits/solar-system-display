It is very hot – the surface temperature of the sun is about +6000° C, but in its centre the temperature reaches up to 15 million° C. <br/><br/>The sun is not empty. It is divided into inner regions and an atmosphere. The inner regions are the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The atmosphere consists of three layers – the photosphere, the chromosphere and the corona. <br/><br/>The visible surface of the sun is formed by the photosphere, from which light and ultraviolet and infrared radiation are emitted.
